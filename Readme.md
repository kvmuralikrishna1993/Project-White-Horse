Project White Horse.
====================

The WHITE HORSE is a tool designed to encrypt small files like text files, images, audio files etc. using AES(Advanced Encryption Standard),a symmetric block algorithm. Further, it uses Secure Hash Algorithms{SHA256} and bcrypt, to generate the hash[digest] using password, which is used to encrypt the data.

#OneWayEncrytion(SHA256 and bcrypt)

#Caution : If key is Lost, data will be Lost.

White Horse will encrypt the data by taking path of the file and password as input.

The detail explanation of each line of code is written in comments above the functions, as well as inside the functions.

===============================================================

To run the tool please install the following packages using sudo pip:

[enter the password for permissions]

$sudo pip install crypto (for Hashing)

$sudo pip install pycrypto (for AES)

$sudo pip install bcrypt (for salting purpose)

$sudo pip install tkinter (for GUI)

The whole code is Written based on Python3.

Thankyou.
